\
## Executive Summary\
\
**PRISM** is a modular AI-powered predictive intelligence platform designed specifically for mid-market healthcare organizations. This capstone project addresses the critical gap in affordable, explainable AI solutions for healthcare companies with $10M-$250M annual revenue.\
\
### Key Value Propositions\
- **25% accuracy improvement** in forecasting\
- **4.5-6.2x ROI** within 18-20 weeks\
- **Explainable AI** with natural language outputs\
- **No in-house AI team required**\
\
---\
\
## Problem Statement\
\
Mid-market healthcare organizations face significant challenges in predictive analytics:\
\
- **Poor forecast visibility** affecting strategic planning\
- **Clinical-commercial disconnect** hindering operational efficiency\
- **Manual Excel-based processes** limiting scalability\
- **Late risk identification** impacting revenue protection\
- **Lack of AI talent** and high implementation costs\
\
The healthcare AI market is growing to $60B by 2030, but existing solutions are either too complex (enterprise-focused) or too basic (manual processes), leaving a $2B serviceable addressable market gap for mid-market players.\
