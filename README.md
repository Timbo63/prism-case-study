# PRISM: Predictive Intelligence Platform Case Study

## Executive Summary

**PRISM** is a modular AI-powered predictive intelligence platform designed specifically for mid-market healthcare organizations. This capstone project addresses the critical gap in affordable, explainable AI solutions for healthcare companies with $10M-$250M annual revenue.

### Key Value Propositions
- **25% accuracy improvement** in forecasting
- **4.5-6.2x ROI** within 18-20 weeks
- **Explainable AI** with natural language outputs
- **No in-house AI team required**

## Problem Statement

Mid-market healthcare organizations face significant challenges in predictive analytics:

- **Poor forecast visibility** affecting strategic planning
- **Clinical-commercial disconnect** hindering operational efficiency
- **Manual Excel-based processes** limiting scalability
- **Late risk identification** impacting revenue protection
- **Lack of AI talent** and high implementation costs

The healthcare AI market is growing to $60B by 2030, but existing solutions are either too complex (enterprise-focused) or too basic (manual processes), leaving a $2B serviceable addressable market gap for mid-market players.
