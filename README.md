## Problem Statement

Mid-market healthcare organizations face significant challenges in predictive analytics:

- **Poor forecast visibility** affecting strategic planning
- **Clinical-commercial disconnect** hindering operational efficiency
- **Manual Excel-based processes** limiting scalability
- **Late risk identification** impacting revenue protection
- **Lack of AI talent** and high implementation costs

The healthcare AI market is growing to $60B by 2030, but existing solutions are either too complex (enterprise-focused) or too basic (manual processes), leaving a $2B serviceable addressable market gap for mid-market players.
